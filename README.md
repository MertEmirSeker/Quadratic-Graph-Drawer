# Quadratic Graph Drawer

This project is a C language command-line application designed to graph quadratic equations and provide a visual representation directly in the console or saved to a text file. It's an excellent tool for educational purposes, helping to visualize how changing coefficients affect the shape and position of a quadratic graph.

## Features

- Interactive Console Application: Easy-to-use command-line interface for inputting quadratic equation coefficients and choosing operations.
- Graph Visualization: Draws the graph of the quadratic equation in the console based on the coefficients provided.
- Save Graph to File: Option to save the graph visualization into a `graph.txt` file for external use or examination.
- Coefficient Management: Saves the entered coefficients to `coefficients.txt` for record-keeping and future reference.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system, such as GCC or Clang.

## How to Use

1. **Enter Coefficients**: Launch the application and select option `0` to input the `a`, `b`, and `c` coefficients for the quadratic equation \(x = a(y^2) + by + c\).
2. **Draw Graph**: After entering coefficients, select option `1` to visualize the quadratic equation's graph directly in the console.
3. **Save Graph**: To save the graph to a file, choose option `2`. The graph will be saved in `graph.txt` for later viewing.
4. **Exit**: Select option `3` to close the application.
